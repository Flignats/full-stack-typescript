			Guide to proposing a new or a change to an existing pattern in the
			codebase or development workflows.

		<ul>
			<li>Why should we use this process?</li>
			<li>Process goals</li>
			<li>RFC process</li>
			<li>Reasons for reference implementation</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Why should we use this process?</h2>
		<p>
			Engineering teams, especially at scale, require guidelines and
			patterns to be effective, transparent and enable adoption.
		</p>
		<h2>Process goals</h2>
		<p>This guide aims to achieve the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Provide a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) to track all process
				changes, so that it's easy for stakeholders to understand
				decisions
			</li>
			<li>
				Create a straightforward format for the team to make, discuss
				and implement decisions regarding process changes
			</li>
			<li>
				Ensure that there is a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) so
				that proposals don't go stale
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>RFC process</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Create an issue using the provided templates and include a
				reference implementation
				<ul>
					<li>
						Requests not using a template can be automatically
						rejected
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Share the RFC issue across shared mediums
				<ul>
					<li>Relevant engineering meeting</li>
					<li>Engineering channel (slack, teams, ect)</li>
					<li>
						Connect with relevant stakeholders (i.e. team leads)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Give the stakeholders time to review the proposal and provide
				comments about the proposal
			</li>
			<li>
				If there is a strong consensus towards a decision
				<ul>
					<li>
						Connect with Engineering Manager to groom and include
						the issue in a relevant timeline
					</li>
					<li>
						Implement the process change using
						<a
							href="https://flignats.gitbook.io/full-stack-typescript/workflows/development-workflow"
							target="_blank"
							>GitFlow</a
						>
					</li>
					<li>Announce process change across appropriate mediums</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				If the decision is not to proceed, the issue should updated with
				the reasons for disagreement and closed
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Reasons for reference implementation</h2>
		<p>
			When an RFC introduces a new pattern the RFC describes high-level
			design decisions about how developers should implement the pattern
			in the codebase.
		</p>
		<p>
			In practice, implementing these patterns can uncover technical
			constraints and low-level design decisions that can profoundly
			change the high-level guidelines in the RFC.
		</p>
		<p>
			Slightly different understandings of the proposed changes can be
			more easily understood when the stakeholders look concrete examples.
		</p>
		<p>
			A reference implementation should satisfy the following conditions:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Provide an example in a real-world situation by using the
				pattern suggested in the RFC to implement a reference solution
				for an existing feature.
			</li>
			<li>
				Provide metrics that demonstrate performance or productivity
				improvements.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			As the RFC progresses, it is recommended that the reference
			implementation also progresses with it. Ideally, upon acceptance of
			an RFC, the reference implementation should be capable of being
			merged as the initial step towards implementing the RFC in its
			entirety.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are situations where creating a reference implementation may
			not be appropriate because the proposal does not involve altering
			code practices or patterns. In such cases, it is advisable to
			substitute the reference implementation with an alternative
			exploration of the specifics, such as a cost-benefit analysis,
			sample documentation, ect.
