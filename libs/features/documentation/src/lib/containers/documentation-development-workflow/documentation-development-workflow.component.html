			GitFlow is a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen.
			It has attracted a lot of attention because it is very well suited
			to collaboration and scaling the development team.
		</p>
		<h2>Key benefits of GitFlow</h2>
		<h3>Parallel development</h3>
		<p>
			GitFlow makes parallel development very easy by isolating new
			development from finished work. New development (such as features
			and non-emergency bug fixes) is done in <b>feature branches</b>, and
			is only merged back into main body of code when the developer(s) is
			happy that the code is ready for release.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are asked to switch from one task to another, all you need to
			do is commit your changes and then create a new feature branch for
			your new task. When that task is done, just checkout your original
			feature branch and you can continue where you left off.
		</p>
		<h3>Collaboration</h3>
		<p>
			Feature branches make it easier for two or more developers to
			collaborate on the same feature, because each feature branch is a
			sandbox where the only changes are the changes necessary to get the
			new feature working. That makes it very easy to see and follow what
			each collaborator is doing.
		</p>
		<h3>Release staging area</h3>
		<p>
			As new development is completed, it gets merged back into the
			<b>develop branch</b>, which is a staging area for all completed
			features that have yet to be released. So when the next release is
			branched off of <b>develop</b>, it will automatically contain all of
			the new development that has been finished.
		</p>
		<h3>Support for emergency fixes</h3>
		<p>
			GitFlow supports <b>hotfix branches</b> - branches made from a
			tagged release. You can use these to make an emergency change, safe
			in the knowledge that the hotfix will only contain your emergency
			fix. There’s no risk that you’ll accidentally merge in new
			development at the same time.
		</p>
		<h2>Change requests</h2>
		<p>
			A change request is a proposal from a stakeholder in the software
			development process to change something in a product or in a product
			process. Common change requests include defects and requests for
			product enhancements or new features.
		</p>
		<p>
			JIRA is a popular development workflow management solution. For
			enterprises at scale, it is common for teams to be comprised of
			stakeholders that oversee specific product domains.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, an ecommerce application may have teams responsible for
			one or more of these domains: Home, Product details, Product search,
			User accounts, Purchase, and others.
		</p>
		<p>
			Change requests then come through as tickets. Tickets names should
			reflect the team making the request and an incremented number.
		</p>
		<p>Example ticket name: purchase-23</p>
		<p>Example hotfix ticket name: HOTFIX-purchase-23</p>
		<h2>Feature development workflow</h2>
		<p>
			New development (new features, non-emergency bug fixes) are built in
			<b>feature branches</b>. Feature branches are branched off of the
			<b>develop branch</b>, and finished features and fixes are
			<b>merged back into the develop branch</b> when they’re ready for
			release.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Verify you are on <b>develop branch</b> and it is updated to
				latest
			</li>
			<li>
				Create a branch off of <b>develop branch</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The new feature branch should be named the same as the
						ticket making the change request - i.e. purchase-23
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				When development is complete,
				<b>create a pull request into the develop branch</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				A pull request review should be conducted to ensure all best
				practices are followed and the change request requirements are
				satisfied
			</li>
			<li>
				Finished features are then merged back into the
				<p>develop branch</p>
				and are ready for next release
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Hotfix development workflow</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Verify you are on <b>master branch</b> and it is updated to
				latest
			</li>
			<li>
				Create a branch off of <b>master branch</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The new feature branch should be prefixed by 'HOTFIX'
						and named the same as the ticket making the change
						request - i.e. HOTFIX-purchase-23
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				When development is complete,
				<b
					>create a pull request into the develop branch and master
					branch</b
				>
			</li>
			<li>
				A pull request review should be conducted to ensure all best
				practices are followed and the hotfix request requirements are
				satisfied
			</li>
			<li>
				Finished hotfixes are then merged into the
				<b>develop branch</b> and are verified as working properly
			</li>
			<li>
				Finished hotfixes are then merged back into the
				<b>master branch</b> and are verified as working properly in
				production
			</li>
		</ol>
