		<p>
			The
			<a
				href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle"
				target="_blank"
				>single-responsibility principle (SRP)</a
			>
			is a computer programming principle that states that "A module
			should be responsible to one, and only one, actor."
		</p>
		<h2>Rule of one</h2>
		<p>
			Apply the single responsibility principle (SRP) to all components,
			services, and other symbols. This helps make the application
			cleaner, easier to read and maintain, and more testable.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Do</b> define one thing, such as a service or component, per
				file
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The goal is to make the code more reusable, easier to read, and less
			mistake-prone. As the application grows, this rule becomes even more
			important.
