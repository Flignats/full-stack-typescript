			A function runs backend code in response to events triggered by
			Firebase features and HTTPS requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			Functions gives developers access to a complete range of fully
			managed Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services including analytics,
			authentication and Firebase/Firestore. Cloud Functions round out the
			GCP offering by providing a way to extend and connect the behavior
			of Firebase features through the addition of server-side code.
		</p>
		<p>
			Firebase developers can easily integrate with external services for
			tasks like processing payments and sending SMS messages. Also,
			developers can include custom logic that is either too heavyweight
			for clients (mobile/web/desktop), or which needs to be secured on a
			server.
